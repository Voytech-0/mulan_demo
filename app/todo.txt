- 'loading...' 'calculating...' are not displaying in the right time
- save locally calculated data and updte the switch in gui
- small per class distribution graph, something like kaggle stts about the dataset down in the datset file
- name the labels by classes
- query option in dataset windowv + info about how to use
- when generative mode on, make the left top window without smaller windows, also iterative slider disapear
- make iterative slider correspond to iterations of algorithm (save intemediate embeddings - maybe absolute pain)
- also when just image data, make just one window for image displaying (no additional metadata on the righ)
- make info about format of cutom data/additional datapoint and implement those
- implement the different distances
- add buttons for add new datapoint and full grid and siplay in the left top corner
- PAC dataset
- fix layout
- implement different image space whatever that means (maybe only diplay it when generative mode: could replace the iterative slider)


- while animation also mapiing of the points, option for images not only dots
- change thumbanails when changed distances - think dash_bootstrap_components
- dataset augmentation 
- information about each dataset
- generate grid
- generative mode
- use saved prec, full grid prec
- augmentation - pls datapoint make into batched instead of osobitne
